## Sponsors

This year's survey is sponsored by [Simplabs](https://simplabs.com/) and [Acorn Consulting](https://www.acornwebconsultants.com/).

## Methodology

Methodology for the survey is available on the site on the [methodology page](https://2022-ember-survey.netlify.app/methodology). Once the survey is closed and the results are processed, we will share the results and more about the specific methodology we used this year.

If you have any questions, please [file an issue](https://github.com/ember-learn/2022-ember-survey/issues) or send an email to survey@emberjs.com.

## Accessibility

This site should pass all accessibility criteria. If you test this site with a tool like aXe, you will notice that potential issues are listed with the select element. We have confirmed that this is not an issue.

You may have noticed that the "Ember Orange" may look a little different this year. This is because we are testing out an [accessible brand color for digital products](https://codepen.io/melsumner/live/JjOmGGr/9916e6454264b056011c38729da47f74)-- that is, the color passes (AA) color contrast against both black and white.  

If you find any problems, [file an issue](https://github.com/ember-learn/2022-ember-survey/issues) or send an email to survey@emberjs.com.
